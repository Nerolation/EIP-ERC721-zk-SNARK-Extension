## EIP-ERC721-zk-SNARK-Extension


#### Addressing Vitalik Buterin's [reply](https://ethresear.ch/t/erc721-extension-for-zk-snarks/13237/2) on Eth Research, who suggested to use stealth addresses without requiring zk-SNARKs or merkle trees, I moved the repository to [this](https://github.com/Nerolation/EIP-ERC-721-Stealth-Addresses) place. Futher development will be done in the linked repo.


###### In this repo you'll find the original idea using merkle trees and zk-SNARKs.
